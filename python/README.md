# Python Code for ICM20948 Unlimited Pen - NOT FUNCTIONAL
This code here is expected to run on a Raspberry PI with the ICM20948 library from Pimoroni installed (https://github.com/pimoroni/icm20948-python).

Additionally for Windows mouse capability the following is necessary:
- Install WiringPi if not preinstalled (this is the case with Raspberry Pi Lite): sudo apt-get install wiringpi
- Install https://github.com/stjeong/rasp_vusb on the Raspberry PI Zero following the given instructions
  -> If pscp gives a Network Error (as in my case): https://github.com/stjeong/rasp_vusb/issues/4
